# Blackwidow Chroma CSGO Assist #

*The Razer Blackwidow Chroma is a beautiful keyboard because of the endless possibilities to intergrate with certain games. No matter if it's Minecraft, Counter-strike or any other game. The Chroma keyboard can be used for everything!*


Welcome to the github repo for the CSGO Assist. In it's current state this only supports a countdown-timer that has been adjusted to compensate for the click and brain delay, when you hear "*Bomb has been planted*" you can calmy press ALT+W to start the countdown on the keyboard.


----------


###Requirements
 * Windows 32-bit or 64-bit
 * [The Razer Chroma SDK](http://developer.razerzone.com/chroma/download/)
 * Visual Studio (To compile)

###How it works
This software is made with a (close to) perfect timer for the bomb to explode, when you hear "*Bomb has been planted*" you press ALT+W to start the countdown.

The *F1 through F12 + PrtSc + ScrLk + Pause/Break* key lights depletes as the time runs out. The other keys flash every 0.25 seconds and are either:
 * **Green** > Can be defused without a defuse kit.
 * **Blue** > Can only be defused with a defuse kit.
 * **Red** > Cannot be defused!

###Side-notes
 * Sorry if the code is sloppy.
 * Yes I do have a website but it's not yet finished
 * I do also have a Minecraft project in development, where the keyboard acts as a health/hunger/air bar and has a compass included + more.
